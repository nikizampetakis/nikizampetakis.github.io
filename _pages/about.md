I am a third year PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at Sciences Po. My main research interests are Industrial Organization and Antitrust/ Competition Economics. I currently work on producers' cartels, how they interact with their retailers and how these interactions affect the market outcomes across the vertical chain.
